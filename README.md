# interviews

This repository holds all of the interview questions that I ask during the live streams on my [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/kensodev).

### Directory structure: 

```
├── answers
└── questions

In `answers`, we have `{questionid}-answer-by-{github-username}`. Each question has a 4 letter unique identifier, just to make it easier to browse the repository.

If you want to answer a question, feel free to do so and open an PR to this repo.

Suggestions/Corrections are always welcome, feel free to open issues/PRs with any fix/suggestion you have. The community makes this reop better.
